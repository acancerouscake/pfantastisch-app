TODO: 
- store all GROCERY store data in the database, including stores that might not have pfand machines,this can be checked against later if they do or not when a user adds a new pfand machine. If there is one already existing, update the pfand available field to (true) so it can bbbe used on the map. 
- Only display pfand machines that I know have machines (eg. rewe, edeka, lidle, kaufland, penny, aldi, netto, veganz, biocompany AKA have boolean value that says it does have one)
- Users need points, and only those with 5 drops off can register new machines (limited to 1), with every level they gain the ability to register a new machine. THOUGH, if it doesn not already exist in the db, thia needs to be checked manually)
